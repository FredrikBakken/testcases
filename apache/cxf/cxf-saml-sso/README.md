cxf-saml-sso
===========

This project contains a number of tests that show how to use the SAML SSO to
authenticate a JAX-RS client. The test contains a (very) basic SAML SSO 
server based on CXF.

The SAML SSO server associates the following users with roles:

 - "alice/boss+employee"
 - "bob/employee"
