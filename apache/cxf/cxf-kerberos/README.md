cxf-kerberos
===========

This project contains a number of tests that show how an Apache CXF service
endpoint can authenticate a client using Kerberos. The service endpoints use a
TransportBinding policy, with an Supporting Kerberos token. The tests start
up a local KDC and thus so external configuration is required.
