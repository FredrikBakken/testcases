camel-zipfile
===========

A test-case for the camel-zipfile component. XML files are read in from
src/test/resources/data and then converted to zip files, which are stored in
target/results. In addition, a zip file is read in from
src/test/resources/zippeddata and unzipped, with the file contents placed 
into target/plaintextresults.
