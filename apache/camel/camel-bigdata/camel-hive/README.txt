camel-hive
==========

This demo shows how to use Camel to invoke on Apache Hive. Create a Table in
Apache Hive called "words" in the "default" database. It has two columns, "word"
and "count". 

The demo loads in files from a "queries" directory and runs the SQL queries they
contain, and then outputs the result from HIVE in target/results.
